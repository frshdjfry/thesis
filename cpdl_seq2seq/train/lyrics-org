Ere yet his last he breathed
To the mer ry monks of Croy land His drink ing horn queathed

Like dew drops in the grass
Like dew drops in the grass
They drank to the saints and mar tyrs

And as soon as the horn was em pty

Yet still in his pal lid fin gers He clutched the gol den bowl
In which

Like sil ver lamps in a dis tant shrine
The stars are spark ling bright
The bells of the ci ty of God ring out For the Son of Ma ry was born to night
The gloom is past
and the morn at last Is com ing with o rient light
Nev er fell mel o dies half so sweet As those which are fill ing the skies
And nev er a pal ace shone half so fair As the man  ger bed where our Sa  viour lies
the man ger bed where our Sa viour lies
No night in the year is half so dear As this which has end ed our sighs
which has end ed our sighs
No night in the year is half so dear
As this which has end ed our sighs
Ne ver fell me lo dies half so sweet As those which are fill ing the skies
No night in the year is half so dear As this which has end ed our sighs
The stars of heaven still shine as at first They gleamed on this won der ful night
The bells of the ci ty of God peal out
And the an gels song still rings in the height
And love still turns while the God head burns
Hid in flesh from flesh ly sight
Faith sees no long er the sta ble floor
The pave ment of sapph ire is there
The light of heaven streams out to the west
And an  gels of God are crowd ing the air
And heaven and earth thro the spot less Birth Are at peace on this night so fair
at peace on this night so fair at peace on this night so fair

A match for the ar mies of hell
A Child is born who shall con quer the foe

When spring time pros pers in the grass
And fills the vale with ten der bloom
And light winds whis per as they pass
Of sum mer days to come In spite of all the joys she brings

How great was life when thou and I were young 
The world was bound less
For we did not know
And life a poem
For we had not sung
Now is the world grown small
and we there on Fill with mere care and toil each nar row day
Elves from the wood
Dreams from my heart are gone And heavn is bare
for God is far a way
Canst thou not come and touch my hand a gain
And I look on thee with grave in no cent eyes 
Thy God has man y an gels
I would fain Woo for one hour one an gel from the skies
O my child love
come back come back to me
And

I had a dream last night
Dream of a friend that is dead He came with dawns first light And stood be side my bed And as he there did stand
With ges ture fine and fair He passed a wan white hand    ver my tum bled hair
  ing No friend ship   eth With death of a ny day
No true friend ship li eth cold with life less clay
Though our boy hoods play time Be gone with sum mers breath
No friend ship fades with May time
No friend ship dies with death 
Then   swer had I made But that the rap ture deep did hold me
Half fraid to mar that rose of sleep
So with clos ed eyes I lay
Lord of the vi sion fair
And when twas per fect day On ly the day was there

Though far I lone ly roved the land or sea As I  hold yon eve ning star
Which yet be holds not me
This morn I climbed the mis ty hill
And roamed the pas tures through
How danced thy form be fore my path A midst the deep eyed dew 
When the red bird spread his sa ble wing
And showed his side of flame
When the rose bud ripen ed to the rose
In both I read thy name
in both I read thy name

When we two part ed in si lence and tears
Half bro ken heart ed
to se ver for years
Pale grew thy cheek and cold
Cold er thy kiss
True ly that hour for told Sor   row to this 
The dew of the morn ing Sulk chill on my brow
It felt like the warn ing Of what I feel now
Thy vows are all bro ken
And light is thy fame I hear thy name spo ken And share in its shame
They name thee be fore me
A knell in my ear
A shud der comes oer me  Why wert thou so dear 
They know not I knew thee Who knew thee too well Long
long shall I rue thee Too deep   ly to tell
In se cret we met In si lence I grieve That thy heart could for get
Thy spi rit de ceive
If I should meet thee Af ter long years
How should I greet thee 
With si   lence and tears

There is a land of plea sure
Where peace and joy ev er roll
rest my soul
Long dark ness dwelt round me
With scarce ly once a chee ring ray
But since the Sa vior found me
A lamp has shone a long my way
My way is full of dan ger
But tis the path that leads to God
hea venly road
Now I must gird my sword on
My breast plate
hel met
and my shield
And fight the hosts of tan
Un til I reach the hea venly field
Im on the way to Zi on
Still guar ded by my Sa viors hand
hap py land
To all that stay hind me
I bid a long
a sad fare well
O come
or youll re pent it
When you shall reach the gates of hell
The vale of tears rounds me
And Jor dans cur rent rolls be fore
wa ters roar
Whose hand shall then port me
And keep my soul from sink ing there
From sink ing down to ness
And to the re gions of pair
ter nal source of ev ry joy
Well may thy praise our lips ploy
While in thy tem ple we pear
Whose good ness crowns the circ ling year
While in thy tem ple we pear

The Son of God

And freed the soul from dan ger

The Word which heavn and earth did make

The Word was now made flesh in deed
And took on Him our ture

To make us heirs of glo ry
To see this Babe all in no cence

While walk ing near a ri ver clear One morn ing sweet in May

And birds sang on each spray

When lov ers meet gain
Then  scure ways grow plain
Then crook ed path are straight and the rough pla ces smooth
Then wea ri ness and weight Have wings as wide as love
For night is as the day
Love smiles loves tears a way And all hard paths are smooth
When lov ers
when lov ers meet gain
When lov ers kiss gain The dry bough blos soms then
Then rolls a way the stone
Earths bit ter ness is balm
Light through the night is blown
Peace rocks the world in calm
And the ebb ing tide is full For two souls are one soul
And  scure ways grow plain
When lov   ers
when ers meet gain

Sun set and eve ning star
And one clear call for me
And may there be no moan ing of the bar
When I put out to sea
But such a tide as mov ing seems sleep
Too full for sound and foam
When that which drew from out the bound less deep Turns gain home
Twi light and eve ning bell
And af ter that the dark
And may there be no sad ness of well
When I bark
For
tho from out our bourne of Time and Place The flood may bear me far
I hope to see my Pi lot face to face When I have crost the bar
As pants the hart for cool ing streams When heat ed in the chase
So longs my soul
O God

And thy fresh ing grace

Hear my prayer O Lord
and let my cry ing come un to thee
 Hide not my face from me in the time of my trouble incline thine ear unto me when I call   O hear me and that right soon
way like smoke and my bones are burnt up as it were a firebrand
 My heart is smitten down and with erd like grass get to eat my bread
 For the voice of my groaning my bones will scarce cleave to my flesh
 I am become like a pe li can in the wilderness and like an owl that is in the desert
 I have watchd   and am even as it were a sparrow lone on the housetop
 Mine enemies revile me all the day long and they that are mad upon me are sworn geth er gainst me
 For I have eaten ashes as it were bread and min gled my drink with weeping
na tion and wrath for thou hast taken me up and cast me down
 My days are gone like a shadow and I am with erd like grass
 But thou O Lord shalt en dure for ever out all rations
 Thou shalt arise and have mer cy up on Sion for it is time that thou have mercy upon her
yea the time is come
 And why   thy ser vants think up on her stones and it pitieth them to see her in the dust
 The heathen shall fear thy Name O Lord and all the kings of the earth thy Majesty
 When the Lord shall build up Sion and when his glo ry shall pear
 When he turneth him unto the prayer of the poor destitute spis eth not their sire
 This shall be written for those that come after and the people which shall be born shall praise the Lord
 For he hath lookd down from his sanctuary out of the heaven did the Lord hold the earth
 That he might hear the mournings of such as are in tivity and deliver the child ren point ed un to death
 That they may declare the Name of the Lord in Sion and his wor ship at rusalem
 When the people are ga therd gether and the kingdoms al so to serve the Lord
 He brought down my strength in my jour ney and short ened my days
 But I said   O my God take me not away in the midst of mine age dure through out all rations

Like sil ver lamps in a dis tant shrine
The stars are spark ling bright
The bells of the ci ty of ring out
For the God Son of Ma ry was born to night
The gloom is past
and the morn at last Is com ing with o rient light
Ne ver fell me lo dies half so sweet As those which are fil ling the skies 
And nev er a pa lace shone so fair As the half man ger bed where our Sa viour lies
No night in the year is half so dear As this which has end ed our sighs
Now a new power has come on the earth
A match for the ar mies of Hell A Child is born who shall quer the foe
And con all the spi rits of wick ed ness quell
For Ma rys Son is the Migh ty One Whom the pro phets of God tell
The stars of heaven still shine as at first They gleamed on this won der ful night
The bells of the ci ty of peal out
And the God An gels song still rings in the height
And love still turns where the God head burns
Hid in flesh from flesh ly sight
Faith sees no lon ger the sta ble door
The pave ment of sap phire is there
The clear light of hea ven streams out the world And to An gels of God are crowd ing the air
And heaven and earth
through the spot less birth
Are at peace on this night so fair

Where tri als ne ver come
Nor tears of sor row flow
Where faith is lost in sight
And pat ient hope is crowned
And e ver last ing light Its glo ry throws round
How can I bear to leave thee
One part ing kiss I give thee
And then what eer falls me
I go where hon or calls me
well

my own true love

 Praise the Lord O my soul O Lord my God thou art become exceeding glorious  thou art clothd with ma jes ty and honour
 Thou deckest thyself with light as it were with a garment and spreadest out the hea vens like a curtain
 Who layeth the beams of his cham bers in the waters on the wings of the wind
 He maketh his an gels spirits and his mi ni sters a flam ing fire
da tions of the earth that it nev er should move at a ny time
 Thou coveredst it with the deep like as with a garment
the wa ters stand in the hills
buke they flee at the voice of thy thun der they are fraid
 They go up as high as the hills    and down to the val leys neath even unto the place which thou hast point ed for them
 Thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass gain to co ver the earth
 He sendeth the springs in to the rivers which run mong the hills
 All beasts of the field drink of and the wild ass es quench their thirst
 Beside them shall the fowls of the air have their tation and sing mong the branches
 He watereth the hills from bove the earth is filld with the fruit of thy works
 He bringeth forth grass for the cattle and green herb for the ser vice of man
 That he may bring food out of the earth    and wine that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make him a cheerful countenance and bread to strength en mans heart
 Wherein the birds make their nests and the fir trees are a dwell ing for the stork
 He appointed the moon for cer tain seasons and the sun know eth his go ing down
 The lions roaring af ter their prey do seek their meat from God
way gether and lay them down in their dens
 O Lord how ma ni fold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all    the earth is full of thy riches
 So is the great and wide sea also wherein are things creeping innumerable    both small and great beasts
 There go the ships
and there is that viathan whom thou hast made to take his pas time in
 These wait all up on thee that thou mayest give them meat in due season
 When thou givest it them they gather it and when thou openest thy hand
they are filld with good
 When thou hidest thy face they are troubled
when thou takest away their breath they die   and are  gain to their dust
 When thou lettest thy breath go forth they shall be made new the face of the earth
dure for ever the Lord shall joice in his works
 The earth shall trem ble at the look of him if he do but touch the hills they shall smoke
 I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live I will praise my God while I have my being
 And so shall my words please him my joy shall be in the Lord
 As for sinners    they shall be consumd out of the earth    and the ungodly shall come to an end praise thou the Lord O my soul    praise the Lord
Glory be to the Father and to the Son and to the Ho ly Ghost As it was in the beginning is now and ev er shall be world without end    A men
 The trees of the Lord also are full of sap even the cedars of Li ba nus which he hath planted
 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats and so are the ston y rocks for the conies
 Thou makest darkness that it may be night wherein all the beasts of the for est do move
 Man goeth forth to his work and to his la bour til the evening
Thee will I bless
my God and King
Thy end less praise claim
thy end less praise claim
This tri bute dai ly I will bring
And e ver bless thy name

At the mid hour of night
when stars are weep ing
I fly To the lone vale we loved
when life shone warm in thine eye
And I think oft
if spi rits can steal from the re gion of air
To vis it past scenes of light
thou wilt come to me there
And tell me our love is mem bered
evn in the sky
Then I sing the wild song twas once such plea sure to hear
When our voi ces ming ling breathd
like one
on the ear
And
Ech o far off thro the vale my sad or i son rolls
I think
oh my love
tis thy voice from the King dom of Souls Faint ly an swer ing still
the notes that once were so dear

It is not the tear

When all high er griefs have ded
Thus his mem or y

And no fresh er flow ers the sod per fume Where bu ried saints are ly ing

There was a wood
a wit ches wood
All the trees in were pale
They bore no bran ches green and good But as it were a gray nuns veil
They talked and chat tered in the wind From morn ing dawn to set of sun
Like men and wo men that have sinned
Whose thou sand e vil tongues are one
Their roots were like the hands of men
Grown hard and brown with clutch ing gold
Their fol iage wo mens tress es when The hair is with ered
thin and old
There nev er did a sweet bird sing For hap py love a bout his nest
The clus tered bats on e vil wing Each hol low trunk and bough sessed
And in the midst a pool there lay Of wa ter white
as tho a scare Had fright ened off the eye of day And kept the Moon  flect ed there

And he tra versed the sea
as the ea gles flee
When they gaze on their blue mi nions
His whole earth life was a con quering strife
And he lived till his beard grew hoa ry
And he died at last by his blood red mast
And now
he is lost in his glo ry
So shout and sing of the great Sea King
And ride in the track he rode in
He sits at the head of the migh ty dead
On the red right hand of O din
On the red right hand of O din
  Come sing
come sing of the great Sea King
And the fame that now hangs oer him
Who once did sweep oer the van quished deep
And drove the world fore him
His deck was a throne on the o cean lone
And the sea was his park of plea sure
Where he scat tered in fear the hu man deer
And rest ed when he had lei sure
Come shout and sing of the great Sea King
And ride in the track he rode in
He sits at the head of the migh ty dead
On the red right hand of O din

The woods are bare And brown
the herd Stand in the yard
The frost doth fall
And round the hill The hares move slow
The home ward crow
A lone and high
Cros ses the sky All si lent ly
The quick streams freeze
The mov ing trees Are still
for now No breeze will blow
The wind has gone With the day
down
And clouds are come Bear ing the gloom

No lon ger mourn for me when I am dead Than you shall hear the sur ly sul len bell Give warn ing to the world that I am fled From this vile world with vi lest worms to dwell Nay if you read this line
mem ber not the hand that writ it
for I love you so That I in your sweet thoughts would be  got If think ing on me then should make you woe
Oh if
I say
you look up on this verse When I per chance pound ed am with clay
Do not so much as my poor name hearse
But let your love Een with my life cay
Lest the wise world should look in to your moan
And mock you with me af ter I am gone
ter I am gone
There is a house not made with hands
ter nal and on high
And here my spi rit wai ting stands
Till God shall bid it fly
till God shall bid it fly
There is a house not made with hands

 Whoso do eth these things shall ne ver fall

Stole a mai den from her place
Light ly to the war rior stepped
Took the face cloth from the face
Yet she nei ther moved nor wept

Will he come
the last and best

Pro phet of days to be

And on his breast a deep toned lyre
And on his lips a word like fire To burn the an cient wrong
Bay crowned and good lier than a king
With voice both strong and sweet The song of free dom he will sing And I from out of ther crowd shall fling My rose wreath at his feet

When vows were pledgd in the bri dal hour

When a mon arch was crownd

With the deep bass note and the boom ing roar Of the guns that an swerd from shore to shore

When a na tions joy their mu sic tells
But the bel fry towr has its work of woe
When the pass ing bell tolls long and slow
While the i vy climbs
while the i vy climbs

While the i vy climbs

We must bow to sor row
and some times weep

And it makes us dream of the days gone by
The old grey towr neath the twi light sky
The old grey towr neath the twi light sky
Though its sum mer suit is fresh ly green
And the lit tle birds build the leaves be tween
Slow and so lemn ly toll the bells
When of woe and death their sic tells
of rest and peace
When the stir and the clang of the wor kers cease
And the church bells ring ing
and the church bells ring ing on Sab bath morn
And the church bells ring ing on Sab bath morn And joy to the blest
and com fort the lorn

For they wa ken the heart to faith and love
While they lure our thoughts to a world a bove

And it seems so meet that the lit tle birds sing Round the bel fry towr while the church bells ring
Ten der ly peal the Sab bath bells

Oh

Where the lit tle birds build the leaves be tween And they twit ter

And they twit ter a round its old grey pate
Their lit tle love songs
each one to its mate

Has its se crets hid which it wont be tray

For a hun dred years its bells have chimd While the moss es crept

When of hu man joy their mu sic tells

Un der a spread ing chest nut tree
The vil lage smi thy stands
The smith
a migh ty man is he
With large and sin ewy hands
And the mu scles of his braw ny arms Are strong as i ron bands
His hair is crisp
and black and long
His face is like the tan
His brow is wet with ho nest sweat
He earns what eer he can
And looks the whole world in the face
For he owes
he owes not a ny man
Week in
week out
from morn till night
You can hear his bel lows blow
You can hear him swing his hea vy sledge
With mea sured beat and slow
Like a sex ton ring ing the vil lage bell
When the eve ning sun is low
And child ren com ing home from school
Look in at the o pen door
They love to see the flam ing forge
And hear the bel lows roar
And catch the burn ing sparks that fly Like chaff
like chaff from a thresh ing floor
He goes on Sun day to the church
And sits a mong his boys
He hears the par son pray and preach
He hears his daugh ters voice
Sing ing in the vill lage choir
And it makes his heart joice
It sounds to him like her mo thers voice
Sing ing in dise
He needs must think of her once more
How in the grave she lies
And with his hard
rough hand he wipes A tear out of his eyes
Toil ing
re joic ing
sor row ing
On ward through life he goes
Each morn ing sees some task be gun
Each eve ning sees its close
Some thing at tem pted
some thing done
Has earned a nights pose
Thanks

Seat ed one day at the or gan
I was wea ry and ill at ease
And my fin gers i dly O ver the nois y keys
I know not what I was playing
Or what I was then
But I struck one chord of mu sic
Like the sound of a great men
Like the sound of a great men
It flooded the twilight
Like the close of an An gels Psalm
And it lay on my fe vered spir it
With a touch of in fi nite calm
It qui et ed pain and sor row
Like love strife
It seemed the harmonious ech o From our discordant life
linked all per plex ed meanings Into one per fect peace
And trembled a way in to si lence
As if it were loath to Isought but I seek it vainly
That one lost chord divine
Which came from the soul of the organ
And entered into mine
It may be that Deaths bright Angel Will speak in that chord again
It may be that only in Heavn I shall hear that grand Amen
It may be that Deaths bright Angel
Will speak in that chord gain
It may be that on ly in Heavn I shall hear that grand men

And my vine  the a brings To whis per at the grates
When I lie tan gled in her hair
Or fet tered to her eye
The Gods that wan ton in the air Know no such li ber ty
When flow ing cups run swift ly round With no all ay ing Thames
Our care less heads with ro ses crowned
Our hearts with loy al flames
When thirs ty grief in wine we steep
And healths and draughts go free
Fish es that tip ple in the deep Know no such li ber ty
Stone walls do not a pri son make
Nor i ron bars a cage
Minds in o cent and qui et take That for an her mi tage If I have free dom in my love
And in my soul am free
An gels lone that soar a bove En joy such li ber ty

All is not gold that shi neth bright in show
Not ev ry flower so good as fair to sight
The deep est streams bove do calm ly flow
And strong est sons oft the taste light
The plea sant bait doth hide the hook
And false ceit can lend a friend ly look
